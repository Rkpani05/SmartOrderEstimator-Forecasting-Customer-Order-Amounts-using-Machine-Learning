# SmartOrderEstimator-Forecasting-Customer-Order-Amounts-using-Machine-Learning

The SmartOrderEstimator is a machine learning model designed to predict the order amount that customers can place in the upcoming days. It utilizes historical data and various features to provide accurate estimations, enabling businesses to plan their inventory, manage resources effectively, and make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the SmartOrderEstimator model can be downloaded from [here](https://example.com/dataset).

## Key Features

- **Data Sanity**: Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and handle missing or incorrect data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Enhance the predictive power of the model by creating new features and selecting relevant ones.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train and evaluate various regression models to predict order amounts.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared.

## Installation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
``` ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is in the proper format and contains relevant columns such as order creation date, requested delivery date, order amount, and customer information.

2. Run the data sanity checks: Use NumPy and Pandas to perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, converting date columns, and removing inconsistent records.

3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): Use visualizations and statistical analysis techniques to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distribution of variables, and identify any patterns or correlations.

4. Perform feature engineering and selection: Create new features by grouping existing columns, perform transformations on continuous variables, and identify important features using techniques like correlation analysis.

5. Train and evaluate machine learning models: Implement regression models such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. Train these models on the prepared dataset and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

6. Select the best model: Compare the accuracies of different models and select the one that provides the best performance in predicting order amounts.

7. Perform hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune the selected model by optimizing hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance.

8. Generate predictions: Use the tuned model to make predictions on new or unseen data.

9. Evaluate the model: Calculate evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R-Squared to assess the accuracy and performance of the model.

10. Make informed decisions: Utilize the predictions and insights provided by the SmartOrderEstimator to optimize inventory management, resource allocation, and decision-making processes in your business.
